# Mistral Code Assistant: Developer Lifecycle Demo Script

Have you ever wondered how AI can transform the daily workflow of a software engineer?  
Today, we'll explore how Mistral’s code assistant supports each stage of the developer lifecycle — making the entire process more efficient and effective.

## Code Base Understanding

We start from the **Knowledge Base** — which includes code, documents, issues, PRs, and internal company standards.

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, Mistral can provide context-aware answers. For instance, if you ask, 'How does the authentication module interact with the database layer?' or 'What is the code style standard for my company?', Mistral can quickly provide detailed insights, helping engineers onboard faster and spend less time digging through code.

## Feature Planning

Imagine you're planning a new feature for your trading strategies. Mistral can help by surfacing related modules, summarizing component responsibilities, and even finding prior TODOs or open issues related to it. This ensures you have all the information you need to define the scope and review architectural constraints effectively.

## Code Generation

After the plan, it comes **code generation**. This is where Mistral really accelerates productivity. With context-aware capabilities, Mistral can draft internal docs, write unit tests, and suggest helper utilities, all tailored to your specific codebase.

## Troubleshooting

Now that we’ve seen Mistral assist with code generation, let’s move on to troubleshooting.

In the demo, you saw Mistral’s code proactively analyze the generated code. If it finds an issue, it doesn’t just suggest a fix — it automatically tests the code, identifies the problem, and applies a working fix.

You get a fully functional version without leaving your IDE or losing focus — all handled by Mistral in real-time.

## Ops Activities

Finally, during the ops phase, it helps you stay productive by surfacing open issues related to the code you just worked on, generating PR summaries, and suggesting improvements during review — like missing tests or docs.

With this lifecycle powered by Mistral Code Assistant, developers can:
- Ship features faster
- Reduce onboarding time
- Catch issues earlier
- Maintain higher-quality code with less effort

Let’s dive into the demo and see it in action.
